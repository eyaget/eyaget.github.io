I earned my PhD (in January 2019) in *Computer Science* (with a specialization in *Cybersecurity*) from [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/), supervised by [Prof. Sudipta Chattopadhyay](https://sudiptac.bitbucket.io/), [Prof. Martin Ochoa](https://martin-ochoa.github.io/) and [Dr. Huaqun Guo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huaqun-guo-40677536/). I also received my MSc (in December 2012) in *Computer Science* from [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), supervised by [Prof. Bruno Crispo](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/bruno), and my BSc (in July 2008) in *Computer Science & IT* from [Arba Minch University](https://www.amu.edu.et/). 

Currently, I am a *Research Scientist* in Cybersecurity at the [Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) (in Singapore). Previously, I was a *Software Engineer* at Femar Consulting s.r.l (in Italy), an *Assistant Researcher* in Cybersecurity at the [Security \& Trust (ST)](https://st.fbk.eu/) unit of [Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK)](https://www.fbk.eu/en/) (in Italy), a *Junior Researcher* (Research Intern) at [Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC)](http://adsc.illinois.edu/) (in Singapore) and a *Software Developer* in Cybersecurity at [Information Network Security Agency (INSA)](https://www.insa.gov.et/) (in Ethiopia) . 

<!-- I am interested in include privacy and security of computer systems and critical infrastructures.-->
